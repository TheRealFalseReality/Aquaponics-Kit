# About

Code for [**Atas Scientific Wi-Fi Aquaponics Kit**](https://atlas-scientific.com/product/wi-fi-aquaponics-kit/) to be compatable with [**ESPHome**](https://esphome.io/) and [**HomeAssistant**](https://www.home-assistant.io/) using [**Adafruit HUZZAH32 â€“ ESP32 Feather Board**](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405).  
This code will communitcate with all the sensors and send the data to HomeAssistant. The ESP device should be automatically discovered in your HomeAssitant instance once ready. Another .bin file as well as source code for calibration is located on the GitHub page for this project    

**Sensors** for this kit are:  
```
Temperature  
pH   
Conductivity (Salinity)  
Dissolved Oxygen  
Humidity  
CO2 (in air)  
Controlled Doser Pump  
```

## USB
You can use the button below to install the pre-built firmware directly to your device via USB from the browser. Then, while still connected to USB, connect to WiFi, then add to HomeAssisatnt.

<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/esp-web-tools@9.1.0/dist/web/install-button.js?module"></script>

## WiFi
The device will set up its own hotspot when it cannot connect to a WiFi network. On another device, connect to the `aquaponics-kit` network using `password` (there should be no internet access), then follow the next page that should pop up to enter your WiFi credentials. It should connect and be discoverble in your HomeAssistant instance.
